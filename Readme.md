Install modules: npm install

To run server locally, firstly run local db using (docker-compose up) and then run (npm run dev)
Tests are using the same db for simplicity there before running (npm run test), ensure that you have run (docker-compose up)

Will include local .env vars file for simple app setup, although bad practice
